# RAGify-Gemini ðŸš€

Welcome to **RAGify-Gemini**, a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative AI to answer questions with precision and context. This repository provides a ready-to-use implementation of RAG using LangChain, Google Gemini, and Chroma vector store, designed for developers and researchers to build intelligent question-answering systems.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)? ðŸ§ 

RAG is an AI framework that enhances generative models by retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base before generating responses. It combines a retriever (to fetch contextually relevant data) with a generator (to produce coherent answers), making it ideal for question-answering, research, and knowledge-intensive tasks. This approach ensures responses are grounded in factual, external data while maintaining natural language fluency.

## Features âœ¨
- **Modular RAG Pipeline**: Built with LangChain, Google Gemini embeddings, and Chroma vector store.
- **Web-Based Knowledge Retrieval**: Scrapes and processes web content for contextual answers.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt to different data sources, models, or prompts.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Clear file structure and setup instructions.
- **MRKL Integration**: Inspired by Modular Reasoning, Knowledge, and Language systems for enhanced reasoning.
